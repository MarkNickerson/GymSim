# GymSim

### Development
Jim the cat has just encountered an enemy vacuum is his territory but can't 
fight it off because he doesn't work out! Help Jim at the gym to learn new 
skills to beat the vacuum in GymSim!

GymSim was developed over the span of one week as the introductory project for 
the UC Davis platform studies class instructed by Josh McCoy. The game is 
developed in Pico-8 using Lua as the programming language.
